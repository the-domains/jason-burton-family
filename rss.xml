            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Prone to Wander</h1><p>I am writing this as I miss church because of some sort of stomach malady. Is it ironic that I'm writing about church faithfulness while I miss? No. When I miss church services, I become acutely aware of my need for the fellowship, worship, encouragement teaching and exhortation I receive.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7b58fa9d0e82810e4729c4f8a6c9e74760124bc6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Isaac Backus, Fighter Against Church Incorporation</h1><p>In October, while on the Baptist Heritage Revival Society tour, I was asked to say a few words at the graveside of Isaac Backus regarding his stand on church incorporation. I would encourage anyone who has the opportunity to attend one of these tours to take advantage of it.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/32f91e99d151b203da2e91dbda5fbae361461bf3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Twice Dead Trees</h1><p>This essay is aimed at my generation of Independent Baptist pastors, in case there is any confusion. Parts of it may, and probably do apply to members of any generation, but I freely admit it is written in frustration with those who are called to stand right now where others have passed away or been defeated in battle.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f713acf321b10957f87cd2d2cea5e4573fe3a3a5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
